Exercise 9.3
Exercise 1:
1. Whatâ€™s the size of the cats/dogs datasets?
"Dogs. Cats "datasets have a size of 25,000. In this exercise, 2,000 out of 25,000 were used.

2. How does the first convnet compare with the one we did in class.
In this exercise, the first convent formed of three layers of convolutions and max-pooling, like the class example. 
In the class, each convolution extracts 32, 64 and 64 filters that are 3x3, but in this exercise 16, 32 and 64 filters that are 3x3. 
The final convolution in the class example did not follow the max-pooling layer, but in this exercise, the max-pooling layer was performed on all convolution.

3. Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?
The pixels of the image have gradually shifted to abstract and compressed representations. 
The first part of the image emphasizes the attention of the network, and fewer and fewer functions become active as they go back. 
Most of them are set to 0, and when the image is not clear, it shows that the image is repeatedly learned.

Exercise 2:
1. What is data augmentation?
Data augmentation augments the data through random transformations to avoid seeing the same data twice. 
This helps prevent overfitting and generalize.

2. Report your best results and the hyperparameters you used to get them.
history = model.fit_generator(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=100,
    epochs=30,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=50,
    verbose=2)
