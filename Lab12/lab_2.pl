% 1. From LPN!
% Exercise 2.1, questions 1, 2, 8, 9, 14 - Give the necessary instantiations.
%   1. bread  =  bread	% true - since the terms unify as they are the same atom.
%   2. 'Bread'  =  bread	% false - since Bread and bread are not the same atom
%   8. food(X)  =  food(bread)		% X = bread
%   9. food(bread,X)  =  food(Y,sausage)	% X = sausage, Y = bread
%   14. meal(food(bread),X)  =  meal(X,drink(beer))	% false

% Exercise 2.2 - Explain how Prolog does its unification and reasoning. If you have issues getting the results youâ€™d expect, are there things you can do to game the system?

% 2. Does inference in propositional logic use unification? Why or why not?

% 3. Does Prolog inferencing use resolution? Why or why not?
