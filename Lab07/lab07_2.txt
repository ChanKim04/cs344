Exercise 7.2
a. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
Categorical data means data composed of textual. Numerical data is number data consisting of integer or float; 
however, in some cases, numerical data such as zip code may be treated as categorical data since it is not data for numerical computation. 

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
task 1
train_model( learning_rate=0.00002,  steps=400, batch_size=4)
    Final RMSE (on training data): 171.23

task 2
train_model( learning_rate=0.00002, steps=800, batch_size=6, input_feature="population")
	Final RMSE (on training data): 177.97

c. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them?
Hyper-parameters are tuning options for users in ML, and in this exercise, learning_rate, batch_size, input_feature and hyper-parameters are hyper-parameters. 
This is not a value to be tuned or optimized since it is a variable that is set and controlled by users, so there is no standard tuning algorithm.
