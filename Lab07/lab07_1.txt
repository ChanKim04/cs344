b. Why would one use Pandas rather than the standard data manipulation features provided by NumPy?
	Pandas is a column-oriented data analysis API. It can analyze and visualize data through a relational data table called DataFrame. However, numpy is used to manipulate vector data and matrices to process data with multidimensional structures. 
c. Under what circumstances would it be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame?
If we do not reorder/shuffle when using merged data, there may be differences between the initial and final results due to the difference in each data set. For this reason, reorder/shuffle is necessary for the consistency of the results. In addition, when choosing data from head and tail via reordering/shuffling, it can give a stable result of arbitrary data.
