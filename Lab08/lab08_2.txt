Exercise 8.2
a. They recommend FTRL for L1 optimization, but the code specifies the same rate (learning_rate) for all runs. How is FTRL managing the learning rate?
    learning_rate is managed through one of the args, learning_rate_power. learning_rate_power controls the decrease in learning_rate during training.

b. What good does the bucketing/binning do?
    There may be no linear correlation between the two specific variables in the overall data. 
    However, there may be a strong correlation between the two variables at certain points. 
    So you can divide those specific points into buckets/bin. In this way, nonlinearities can be mapped in the model.

c. Submit your solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Did you find their task 1 bucketing to make sense? Identify one unique feature cross for task 2 and explain how it could be useful.
Task 1
  bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["latitude"], 10))
  bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["housing_median_age"], 7))
  bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["median_income"], 7))
  bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 7))

    Since the range of latitude is 9.5 and the range of longitude is 10, it is reasonable to make 10 buckets according to the coordinates. 
    Based on the size of the overall data, 7 is reasonable arbitrary value as well since the model is neither too large nor too small.

Task 2
long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(set([bucketized_longitude, bucketized_latitude]), hash_bucket_size=1000)

    It displays well the characteristics that appear in a specific area. 
    It can be learned that the price of a house in a certain area can be higher than other areas, 
    and the difference in population density or age distribution of a specific area can also be learned and predicted.
