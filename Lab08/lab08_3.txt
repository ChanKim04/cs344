Exercise 8.3
a. Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
Seaborn provides a pairplot that allows you to evaluate correlations of several variables simultaneously. 
However, creating a scatterplot matrix using MatPlotLib is more complex. Seaborn is based on MatPlotLib, 
but there is a feature that MatPlotLib doesn't provide, such as pairplot. MatPlotLib, on the other hand, 
has the advantage of setting the detail of the plot.

b. How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
The size of the dataset is 397. It is a relatively small size dataset; however, since data of each variable distributed well, 
it is acceptable to use this size of data when we check the pairplot.

c. Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
The prescribed normalization is used to train the model and prevents to create a model that is dependent on the input unit.

d. Is this an example of a linear regression model?
This is a linear regression model because the shapes presented by the provided plots are close to a linear relation.

e. In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
I agree. If the size of the data is large but the model is simple, the probability of underfitting is high. 
However, if the data size is not sufficient, but the model is complex, there is a risk to be overfitting. 
Since this dataset is small, there is a risk of overfitting, which makes it difficult to generalize to new data. 
Therefore, if the dataset is small, the smaller network is also preferable.
